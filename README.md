An Artifact Repository Manager is a software tool that helps manage and organize the storage and retrieval of software artifacts. It serves as a centralized location where developers can store, share, and manage software components such as libraries, frameworks, binaries, and other build artifacts.
Key features of an Artifact Repository Manager include:
1.	Artifact Storage: It provides a repository to store software artifacts in a structured manner. This can include libraries, binaries, documentation, container images, and other components needed for software development and deployment.
2.	Dependency Management: It helps manage dependencies between software components. Developers can define and retrieve dependencies from the repository, ensuring consistent and reliable access to required components.
3.	Version Control: An Artifact Repository Manager maintains versioning information for artifacts, allowing developers to retrieve specific versions of components and track changes over time.
4.	Access Control: It provides authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to artifacts. This ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can retrieve and publish artifacts.
5.	Proxying and Caching: Artifact Repository Managers can act as a proxy server for external repositories, reducing external dependencies and improving build speed by caching artifacts locally.
